NOTE: Makefile is NOT regularly update. Please report issues if it does not compile
      for your platform.

Please note that the following static libraries should be placed under lib/
- Google Test 1.7.0 
- Crypto++ 5.6.2
- Boost 1.58
 
INSTALLATION
------------

0. Before executing 'make' you must have compiled and installed the following
   libraries:
   - Google Test
   - Crypto++
   - Boost

1. Compile and Install Google Test (assuming you are in the makefile SDK folder)
   - Go into ../gtest-1.7.0/
   - type ./configure
   - type make 
   - Once completed execute the following two commands as reported in the Gtest
     README:
     - g++ -isystem ./include -I. -pthread -c ./src/gtest-all.cc
     - ar -rv libgtest.a gtest-all.o
   - The previous command should generate a libgtest.a library that contains 
     all the Google Test framework functions.
   - Copy the libgtest.a under the folder lib in the makefile SDK directory.
     Place the library under your platform folder (e.g. macos if compiling on Mac)
2. Compile and install Crypto++ 5.6.2
   - Go into ../cryptopp562
   - type make
   - Once completed you can either type 'make install' or manually copy the .a 
     library to the lib folder under your platform.
3. Compile and install Boost
   - Boost is currently needed for Unit Testing only. You may modify the unit test
     source and remove that dependency if necessary 
   - Please refer to Boost website or to your platform for installation details
   - You can either install the library at platform level or copy the necessary
     library under makefile/lib folder.
4. Compiling the SDK C++ library with unit test
   - from the makefile/ folder type 'make'
   - this will generate an executable called mcbp_unit_test
   - make sure you have all the xml files in the ../unit_test/ folder locally copied
     in the folder where you would like to execute the mcbp_unit_test
   - run './mcbp_unit_test' and you should be able to pass all the test cases!
5. Enjoy!
